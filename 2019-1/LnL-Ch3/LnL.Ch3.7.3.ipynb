    "The idea of Monte Carlo integration of $\\int_a^b f(x)dx$ is to use the mean-value theorem from calculus, which states that the integral $\\int_a^b f(x)dx$ equals the length of the integration domain, here $b-a$, times the *average* value of $f$, $\\bar f$, in $[a,b]$.\n",
    "The average value can be computed by sampling $f$ at a set of *random* points inside the domain and take the mean of the function values. In higher dimensions, an integral is estimated as the area/volume of the domain times the average value, and again one can evaluate the integrand at a set of random points in the domain and compute the mean value of those evaluations.\n",

The boundary of the domain $\\partial\\Omega$ is given by the implicit curve $g(x,y)=0$. Such formulations of geometries have been very common during the last couple of decades, and one refers to $g$ as a level-set function and the boundary $g=0$ as the zero-level contour of the level-set function. For simple geometries one can easily construct $g$ by hand, while in more complicated industrial applications one must resort to mathematical models for constructing $g$."

All we know is that the estimated integral should approach 3 as the number of random points goes to infinity.

    "To make a test function, we need a unit test that has identical behavior each time we run the test. This seems difficult when random numbers are involved, because these numbers are different every time we run the algorithm, and each run hence produces a (slightly) different result. A standard way to test algorithms involving random numbers is to fix the seed of the random number generator. Then the sequence of numbers is the same every time we run the algorithm. Assuming that the MonteCarlo_double function works, we fix the seed, observe a certain result, and take this result as the correct result. Provided the test function always uses this seed, we should get exactly this result every time the MonteCarlo_double function is called. Our test function can then be written as shown below."
